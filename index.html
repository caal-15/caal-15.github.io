        <h1>Who's That Guy?</h1>
          <span>
            I'm a software developer specializing in web development, particularly
            in technologies surrounding JavaScript, I'm particularly fond of
            NodeJS for both backend and frontend Development, using express for
            the backend and React, browserify, etc. for the frontend. I have also
            been experimentig with other Technologies like Django.

            I'm also a guitar and bass player and home studio enthusiast, I'm in
            a couple pf Band projects, and have a personal one regarding
            home studio recording, I love to make covers of songs I like and my
            main musical interests revolve around rock-metal.

                Central Node is our first attempt at creating our own viable
                enterprise in the software businnes, all of the members share a
                strong sense of self motivation, and a passion for coding in

                <br />
                As you would expect our forte is developing web applications
                using NodeJS, and Express, we also enjoy working with new
                technologies so we prefer non-sql db models like mongo, we also
                develop apps for Android and iOS using Cordova, or native
                Android if neccessary. <br />
                <br />
                Last but not least we also share love for the Open Source

                Elemental Lab is the very first Web Development Company I have
                worked for, it is a small group of very dedicated people, it
                houses only a 5 people (including myself), and we
                work under very flexible hours, believing the most important
                aspect for development is enthusiasm and comfortable
                programmers.<br />
                <br />
                Elemental works using Django as its backend provider in order to
                take advantage of its many functionalities, React is used for
                frontend development in many specific cases, but in general we
                lean heavily towards server side rendering (importance scale:
                HTML, CSS, and THEN JavaScript).<br />
                <br />
                The star project of the company is x-page, a CMS designed with
                companies in mind. So if you need a beautiful webpage quick be

                I'm the bassist in Abstract Enemy, and it is my main band and my
                only live performing show (at least talking about original
                content), Abstract Eneme dives into a lot of different musical
                genres and influences to come up wuth its music, from Death
                Metal to Blues and Classic Rock.<br />
                <br />
                I'm not one of the founding members of the band, I was lucky to
                know Gustavo (One of the guitar players)  one the former bassist
                left, and he liked my playing, have felt at home ever since in
                the band.<br />
                <br />

                This is my very own Home Studio project, it surfaced originally
                as a way to record my favorite cover songs as I realized that
                the technology to make decent quality recordings at home was
                there, but it has also evolved as a way to record my own
                original content that doesn't really fit elsewhere.<br />
                <br />
                I'm completely self taught, and moreover this project has also
                pushed me to learn to play the electric guitar and work with
                some wonderful people and musicians.<br>
                <br />
                We have covers, arrangements, and original content so if you
                feel the need from some good quality musical content be sure to
